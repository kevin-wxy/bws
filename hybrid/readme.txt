The sulfuric acid catalyzed esterification reaction of 2-butanol and propionic anhydride is a vital industrial process. In this paper, several experiments are conducted via reaction calorimetry to validate that both sulfuric acid and propionic acid have discernible catalytic effects on the reaction. This finding underscores the complex reaction mechanism and difficulty in accurately describing the reaction kinetics through traditional methods. So this paper turns to a kinetic-free black-box model, Gaussian process regression (GPR) model via 24 experiments, as a more adaptable approach. Besides, the best GPR model is combined with traditional heat balance model to generate a hybrid grey-box model, which can give complete knowledge of reaction process. It has been proved that the gray-box model has a pretty good predictive ability and generalization capability. Such a modeling approach may also be applicable to other complex reactions.
